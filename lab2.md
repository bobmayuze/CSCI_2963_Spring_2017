**Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?** 
---
Clearifying the license used for the project can help user have a better understanding of how they can make use of the project. On the other hand, it also protects the rights of developer's rights to inspire them for further implemetation for the project. Free under certain conditions is what we known as freedom.

**Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?**   
---
Firstly, it may lead to a lot of law problems such as the unsafe built-in structure of the project leads to the leak of data. On the other hand, it may also leads to other moral problem such as publishing the further developed code.

	
**Gopher's failure and the open systems model**
---    
I have to say I agree with the [article's](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain) claim. Speak of the this problem, I would say it is really hard to judge that. It is ture that we can get more feedbacks for user, which is quite essential to the further development. However, it is also important to have our own judegement. 
	
**Linux and GPLv2**    
---
Applying GLPv2 on Linux is actually of great importance to inspire other developers develope softwares on this platfrom and promise their rights at the same time. On the other hand, it also makes entering the development process easier for new developers. 
	
**Example project**    
---
- Project: Borilliant Sis
- License: GPLv3
The reasoning for choosing the GPLv3 license is because I would like to have other contribute to my own codes. I could also even learn from others such as how to deal with async prcess.

**Which license for which entity?**    
---
- GPL

I'd say GPL almost fits all kinds of prjects because it encourages people to share codes and prove from it. In other words, it is set for common good.

- LGPL

For LGPL, it fits the project that could be used for other develop groups such as companies, because it can also pretect the rights of these new developers. It would fits for most individual developers.

- Apache/BSD
	
As for this kind of license, I'd say they fit most companies pretty well becasue it promises more rights compared with license like MIT license.

**License for the Project I want to work on**
---

I would like to work on the project called Borilliant Sis. It is a project base on Node.js with a module called phantomjs and cherrio. Phantomjs could help user to stimulate the process of vising a wabpage and login. Cherrio is a module for phrasing the html file into the data I want. The main user of the project would be me only so far, but it could be also used by other rpi students in the future.
